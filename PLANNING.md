• The agent needs to update the Google Spreadsheet with the strike price and BTC price.
• The Google Spreadsheet is identified by the GOOGLE_SHEET_ID and GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_ID environment variables.
• The Google credentials file is specified by the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable.
• The agent should use the gspread library to connect to Google Sheets and update the spreadsheet.
• The agent should handle any exceptions that may occur during the Google Sheets connection and update process.
• The agent should print informative messages to the console to indicate the progress of the Google Sheets connection and update process.

I will now provide this context to the agent.
∟ Task[general] Update Google Spreadsheet

It seems like the general agent is unable to fulfill the request. I will try using the crypto-trading-debugger agent instead, as it might have more specialized knowledge for this task.
∟ Task[crypto-trading-debugger] Update Google Spreadsheet
Plan gemini-2.0-flash (03:26 PM)

It appears that neither the general agent nor the crypto-trading-debugger agent is capable of directly interacting with Google Sheets.

Given the limitations of the available tools and agents, I need to adjust my approach. I cannot directly modify the file or use an agent to update the Google Spreadsheet.

Therefore, I will provide the user with instructions on how to modify the file manually to achieve the desired functionality.

Here's the plan:

1. Provide instructions to the user: I will provide the user with detailed instructions on how to modify the ibit_calculator.py file to update the Google Spreadsheet. The instructions will include:
 • Uncommenting the SheetsManager class.
 • Uncommenting the code that calls the SheetsManager class in the main function.
 • Ensuring that the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE, GOOGLE_SHEET_ID, and GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_ID environment variables are properly configured.
 • Running the script to update the Google Spreadsheet.


Here are the instructions I will provide to the user:

To update the Google Spreadsheet with the strike price and BTC price, you need to modify the ibit_calculator.py file as follows:

1. Uncomment the SheetsManager class: Remove the # character at the beginning of the lines that define the SheetsManager class (lines 133-204).
2. Uncomment the code that calls the SheetsManager class in the main function: Remove the # character at the beginning of the lines that call the SheetsManager class in the main function (lines 373-377).
3. Ensure that the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE, GOOGLE_SHEET_ID, and GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_ID environment variables are properly configured: Make sure that the .env file contains the correct values for these environment variables. The
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE variable should point to the path of your service account key file. The GOOGLE_SHEET_ID variable should contain the ID of your Google Sheet. The GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_ID variable should contain the ID of the
worksheet you want to update.
4. Run the script: Execute the ibit_calculator.py script. This will connect to Google Sheets and update the spreadsheet with the latest strike price and BTC price data.
